There are a very small number of resources for finding detailed information of outdoor rock climbing routes. Most climbers turn to one of only a few apps for mobile devices that aim to solve this problem - Mountain Project. While this app and others have very valuable crowd sourced information, they fail to present it in a way that is meaningful to their users. Another means of finding information on routes is through means of a guidebook. Since most guidebooks have been around for at least a decade with very little revisions and no crowd sourced data, this medium not only fails to deliver information in a meaningful way, it also lacks information about newly discovered and recently updated routes. 

Knowing that the competition is lacking and the desire for a modern solution is very present, we developed an iOS app to solve the problem through augmented reality. 

We also chose to add a few other features to our app that rivaled what the competitors are doing so that we can present a complete package that convinces potential users that we have the one stop app for all outdoor rock climbing related information. These features include a social platform for users to meet and communicate, a means to fully integrate account settings and climbing history from Mountain Project, and an adaptive “Plan your Day” feature that recommends several routes to a user based on their climbing history.
